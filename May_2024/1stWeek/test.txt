🎤 Hey everyone! Welcome back to Code with Poonam!

Today, we’re diving into Array-Based Challenges, an essential topic in JavaScript. Arrays are everywhere in coding interviews, real-world projects, and data manipulation tasks. 
Mastering them will help us to solve problems efficiently and write cleaner, optimized code.

In this video, we’ll cover:
✅ Merging two arrays 
✅ Finding the maximum and minimum values using different approaches
✅ Rotating an array k times
✅ Removing duplicates and unwanted values from arrays
✅ Finding common elements between arrays
✅ Performing mathematical operations like squaring, summing, and averaging numbers in an array
✅ Exploring advanced topics like sliding subarrays, next smaller elements, and prefix sum arrays

These challenges will sharpen your problem-solving skills and help you build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

💡 So, grab your notebook, follow along, and let’s break down these array challenges together! If you get stuck, drop a comment—I’m here to help!
